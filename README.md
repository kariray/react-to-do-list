# To do list (with React, Recoil)

I made a simple TO DO list using React.
Go to website : [https://kariray.github.io/react-to-do-list](https://kariray.github.io/react-to-do-list)

- The ability to create custom categories for users.
- Using localStorage, the ability to retain previous data when reloaded. (with recoil persist)
